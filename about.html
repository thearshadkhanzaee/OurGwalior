                            <h2>Gwalior City</h2>
                            <p>The area in which Gwalior is situated was the core of Gwalior princely state. That state
                                was once the domain of the Sindhia family, a Maratha dynasty that controlled much of
                                northwestern India during the second half of the 18th century. The foundations of the
                                Gwalior state were laid by Ranoji Sindhia about 1745, and the state reached its greatest
                                extent under Sindhia Mahadaji (reigned 1761–94). Mahadaji was the ruler of a vast
                                territory that included parts of central India and Hindustan proper (northern India),
                                while his officers exacted tribute from the principal Rajput rulers, including those of
                                Jaipur and Jodhpur. Under Mahadaji’s grandnephew, Daulat Rao, the Gwalior state lost
                                considerable territory to the British in 1803 and 1818 after losing wars to them. The
                                state came completely under British domination in the 1840s. During the Indian Mutiny of
                                1857–58, the Sindhia ruler of Gwalior remained loyal to the British, but his army joined
                                the mutineers and temporarily occupied Gwalior city before being defeated.</p>

                            <p>One among many hill forts of India, the Gwalior Fort stands on a vast rocky hill named
                                Gopachal. Originally built in sandstone and lime mortar, the fort is one of the
                                prominent structures in Gwalior. The fort has had a long history - sieged and captured
                                by many rulers in the past. At one point of time, the Gwalior fort was regarded as north
                                and central India's most invincible fortress. The fort houses two palaces, ‘Gujari
                                Mahal’ and ‘Man Mandir’, which were built by Raja Man Singh Tomar during the 15th
                                Century. It also houses numerous temples, built by various kings at different point of
                                time. Over the years, the fort has undergone many changes, but remains an important
                                marvel of Gwalior. The fort is also associated with an interesting legend and has a rich
                                history behind it.</p>

                                architectural wonder that adorns the city of Gwalior. As the name suggests, the temple
                                is dedicated to the holy Sun God and was constructed in the year 1988 by the famous
                                industrialist G.D. Birla. Built on the lines of legendary Sun Temple at Konark, Orissa,
                                the Sun Temple of Gwalior is a magnificent amalgam of exquisite architecture in red
                                sandstone and pearly white marble.

                                    This is the square representing Europe. The buildings built in seven different
                                    styles here sing the saga of history. These buildings are made in the styles of
                                    British, Roman, French, Saudi Arabian, Persian, Italian etc. At present, Smart City
                                    Gwalior is working to make them more attractive. Facade lighting is being installed
                                    in these buildings, which is adding to their beauty.

                                    These squares were a sign of prosperity abroad,
                                    these buildings of the 19th century were built by Maharaja Jayaji Rao Scindia and
                                    his son Madhau Rao Scindia. According to historians, Jayajirao Scindia had to go to
                                    many countries in connection with business. There he saw squares, which were a sign
                                    of prosperity. He got a similar square prepared in the form of Maharaj Bada, so that
                                    people from other countries can be attracted. Seeing its beauty, it came to be
                                    called the heartland.

                                <p>Gwalior is an exciting city with a rich heritage, and the Gwalior Zoo is just another
                                    feather in the cap. Established by the royal family Madhao Rao Scindia back in 1922,
                                    the Gandhi zoo (as it is also known) is actually a section of a larger garden known
                                    as Phool Bagh and houses various rare species of animals. Golden peasants, sambhars,
                                    bison, hyena, spotted deer, black bucks and a white tiger forms the variety of wild
                                    animals that can be found here. Several smaller populations of crocodiles, snakes,
                                    monkeys, and birds have also made the zoo their home.
                                    <br class="d-lg-block d-none">
                                    Due to its inhabitation of rare species of wild animals, the 8 hectares of land that
                                    constitutes the zoo has been declared to be a protected site, maintained by the
                                    Municipal Corporation of Gwalior as part of its inheritance. The Phool Bagh was
                                    inaugurated by the Prince of Wales almost a hundred years ago, and it continues to
                                    be well-maintained and conserved even today, including the provision of good and
                                    clean habitation facilities for the animals. The Phool Garden also houses a prayer
                                    hall, gurudwara, mosque as well as a theosophical lodge.

                                <h2>Gurudwara Data Bandi Chhod</h2>
                                <p>The most familiar version has Emperor Jahangir being warned by Murtaja Khan, Nawab of
                                    Lahore, who noticed that Guru Ji had constructed the Sri Akal Takhat Sahib, 'The
                                    Throne of the Almighty', at Amritsar, and was also strengthening his army, he
                                    informed the Mughal Emperor Jahangir about this incorrectly, emphasizing that the
                                    Sikh Guru was making preparations to take revenge for his father's torture and
                                    martyrdom. When Jahangir heard about this he at once sent Wazir Khan and Guncha Beg
                                    to Amritsar in order to arrest Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji. Given the severity of the
                                    brutal torture inflicted on Guru Arjan, Jahangir would have had ample reason to
                                    believe that the young Guru was coming for his head.

                                    But Wazir Khan, who was an admirer of Guru Hargobind, requested the Guru to
                                    accompany them to Delhi telling him that Emperor Jahangir wanted to meet him. Guru
                                    Sahib accepted the invitation and soon reached Delhi. However Guru Hargobind was a
                                    man totally assured of himself who by his mere appearance and evident holiness
                                    charmed Jahangir and his wife Noor Jahan (said to be the real power in Jahangir's
                                    Darbar.) . But the same evil men who had plotted the arrest and torture of Guru
                                    Arjan hatched a plot aimed at similar fate for Guru Hargobind. </p>
